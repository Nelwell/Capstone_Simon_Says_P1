<p>Employers are commonly asking for a link to a GitHub repository as part of the application process. Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>It shows you can use version control</li>
<li>Show off examples of your code - can you write quality code? Can you work on projects, and other things beyond assignments?&nbsp;</li>
<li>Show off other skills that are desirable - for example, including tests for your code</li>
<li>To have examples of your projects that you can talk about in interviews</li>
</ul>
<p>Students can sign up for a <strong>GitHub student pack</strong>, which enables you to create free private repositories. You can sign up here:&nbsp;<a href="https://education.github.com/pack">https://education.github.com/pack</a></p>
<p>Or,&nbsp;<strong>Create another GitHub repository.</strong> Use one for your portfolio, and use the other one for your work-in-progress, forks of stuff you may or may not be working on, assignments, and unfinished projects. &nbsp;In every project's settings, there's a link to transfer ownership to another account.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Repositories: remove clutter and improve quality</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Finish/fix bugs in projects, and review projects to improve the code quality</strong>, here's some tips:&nbsp;<a href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=5220889&amp;type=content&amp;rcode=MNSCU_LOCA-21761550" target="_self">Code Quality</a></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;Remove forks</strong>&nbsp;and other people's code, that you are not working on. If there are projects you are interested in, star them instead.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Assignments: hide, remove</strong>, or group them into one large, organized repository, using directories for organization</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>Unfinished/broken projects - hide, or move to another account&nbsp;</strong>keep things that work but you'd like to add more features. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Make your GitHub account&nbsp;interesting and informative</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong></strong></span></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;README.md</strong></p>
<p>Create a README.md for each project. Describe the project, and any instructions/information needed to run the project. When you create a README.md in the root directory of a project, GitHub will display the text in that file beneath the code on that repository's page.</p>
<p>Format the README.md using Markdown and consider adding screenshots of the project in action, and/or some sample output. Markdown is formatting characters added to a plain text file that are converted to HTML. Markdown reference here: <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Example README.md files:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/jayphelps/git-blame-someone-else">https://github.com/jayphelps/git-blame-someone-else</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/minneapolis-edu/monopoly/blob/master/README.md">https://github.com/minneapolis-edu/monopoly/blob/master/README.md</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp; Highlight your best projects</strong></p>
<p>Pin your best projects to the front page. What are you most proud of, what is most interesting, what is most relevant to jobs you want to get? These should definitely have README.md files and you should review and polish the code in these projects.&nbsp;This will also help when you get an interview, you'll be ready&nbsp;to talk about the projects!&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp; Write tests for your best projects (if not all of them)</strong></p>
<p>Employers want someone who cares about correct, quality code, and can write unit tests. So demonstrate that in your repository.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp; Create a Profile</strong></p>
<p>Add something to your profile. You'll probably want to avoid personal information, as GitHub is public, but write something about your skills, and/or motivation to be a developer - something short is good. Change the image from the default.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp; GitHub pages</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider creating a web page for your GitHub account, with more information about you and your skills. <a href="https://pages.github.com/">https://pages.github.com/</a>. You'll have a page live at username.github.io which you can add to a resume.
